# Exploratory-and-Classification-Analysis-of-the-penguin-dataset

The idea of the classification algorithm is
very simple. We predict the target class by analyzing
the training dataset. We use training datasets to obtain
better boundary conditions that can be used to
determine each target class. Once the boundary
condition is determined, the next task is to predict the
target class. The entire process is known as
classification. Classification is a form of supervised
learning where the response variable is categorical,
as opposed to numeric for regression. Our goal is to
find a rule, algorithm, or function which takes as
input a feature vector, and outputs a category
which is the true category as often as possible.

This project looks to make analysis on the penguin
dataset and make predictions using classification
methods. The specific goals of this project are.
1. Perform Exploratory analysis on the dataset
to understand the features of the dataset, the
variables and the relationship between each
variable.
2. To partition our dataset into 2 parts, training
and test partition
3. To build a classification model using various
classification methods and to fit our train data
into this model in order to train our data to
make predictions.
4. To predict the gender of a penguin based on
its physical characteristics.
5. To validate our modelâ€™s predictions by using
a confusion Matrix
6. To compare each classification algorithm
used based on the accuracy metric to see
model performed best and which method is
more accurate in making predictions.
7. To determine which variable played a very
important role in determining the gender of
the penguin.
